This direcotry is used for portablity check and some experimental stuff.
All firmware is tested with MSP430F2274 on RF2500T.

**** firmware list *****

dfw :  DFW firmware for F2274. 
       You need 3V serial interface for your host. eZ430U with 
       PTFW can be used for this purpose.

../fetuif/minidfw  :
../ez430u/minidfw  :
       These are stripped down version of dfw, will do
       1) update EEPROM to make target FET a usbmodem,
          so that dmwt can be usable.
       2) wait for firmware update. (dmwt -f)

writemini : 
       Write minidfw into target FET, either FET430UIF or eZ430U,
       through JTAG. This is standalone program, no host needed,
       Since writemini embeds minidfw in the flash.

ebfw : a test program to check functionarity of ../ez43u/ptfw

See uif_f2274.c and uif_macros.h for JTAG pin assignments.
