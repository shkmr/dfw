This is the firmware source of a simple USB to serial converter based
on a TUSB3410 chip. This firmware was written to interface cell phone
with a FreeBSD host, but this code should be usable for other applications too.

The code bases heavily on the firmware from BMLS project 
(www.ibbro.de/refdownlo.html).

You will need the 'SDCC' to compile the code. SDCC can be found at
http://sdcc.sourceforge.net.

You will also need gcc to compile the accompanying 'ihex2flat' in
the ihex subdirectory. 'ihex2flat' is a very small and simple program
just to convert an intel hex file into a loadable binary file. There
might be other solutions for this on the net.
